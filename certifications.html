      <p>
  Hi, I’m Rex Angelo Basulgan — an IT professional passionate about building secure, reliable, and user-centered technology solutions. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at BYU–Hawaii, I bring hands-on experience in IT support, systems administration, cybersecurity, and cloud technologies like AWS.<br><br>

  With a background in both technical consulting and leadership, I’ve led teams, trained new hires, and tackled real-world problems in academic and organizational environments. I’m driven by a desire to make technology work better for people.<br><br>

  Originally from the Philippines, I’m fluent in both English and Filipino and love connecting with diverse communities. I believe that technology should be empowering, secure, and accessible — and I’m here to help make that happen.<br><br>

  When I’m not troubleshooting systems or refining my skills in IT infrastructure, you might find me exploring web development, tinkering with code, or supporting campus media services with a smile.<br><br>

  Let’s build something great together.
</p>
